# Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Accelerate Finite Element Analysis
Finite element method is the most popular technique for stress analysis of solid materials in the literature. Calculating stress distribution in physical systems requires extensive computational resources through implementing software packages, and can take hours, days or weeks to execute for complex geometries. More importantly, if a simple change has to be applied in the boundary conditions of material properties, the simulation need to be redone from scratch to apply new conditions. These drawbacks of conventional stress analysis methods limit opportunities for interactive design. Recent advances in deep learning algorithms demonstrate that by approperiate selection of models and with the cost of minor additional computational errors we can significantly speed up the material stress analysis methods by two order of magnitudes. In this note, I discuss the feasibility of complementing finite element studies with deep learning through providing a case study.
