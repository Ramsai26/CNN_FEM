Modeling of physical systems includes extensive use of software packages that
implement the accurate finite element method for solving differential equations considered
along with the appropriate initial and boundary conditions. When the problem size becomes
large, time needed to solve the resulting linear systems may range from hours to weeks, and
if the input parameters need to be adjusted, even slightly, the simulations has to be re-done
from scratch. Recent advances in machine learning algorithms and their successful
applications in various fields demonstrate that, if properly chosen and trained, these models
can significantly improve conventional techniques. In this note we discuss possibilities to
complement the finite element studies with machine learning and provide a case study.
